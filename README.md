## How to Play

To play the Mastermind Game, follow these basic instructions:

1. **Guess the secret code:** The computer generates a secret code consisting of a sequence of colors.

2. **Make your guesses:** You have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct combination of colors.

3. **Receive feedback:** After each guess, you will receive feedback in the form of pegs. These pegs indicate the correctness of your guess.

   - In Level 1, the feedback pegs are in order, meaning they correspond to the positions of the correct colors in your guess.

   - In Level 3, the feedback pegs are no longer in order, making the game more challenging.

4. **Keep an eye on the timer:** In levels 6, 7, and 8, a timer is introduced to add an extra element of difficulty. You must solve the code within the given time limit.

5. **Level-specific rules:**
   - **Level 1:** Guess the 4-color code with 6 color choices and 10 attempts.
   - **Level 2:** Same as Level 1 but with 3 additional colors and 8 attempts.
   - **Level 3:** Same as Level 1 but with feedback pegs not in order.
   - **Level 4:** Same as Level 3 but with 8 attempts.
   - **Level 5:** Same as Level 4 but with 9 color choices.
   - **Level 6:** Same as Level 5 but with a 3-minute timer.
   - **Level 7:** Same as Level 6 but with a 2-minute timer.
   - **Level 8:** The most challenging level with a 1-minute timer.

## Game Levels

Each level offers a unique challenge, and as you progress to higher levels, the game becomes more demanding.

Remember that in some levels, the computer-generated code can include multiple instances of the same color or colors, making it even trickier to crack the code.

Have fun and test your code-breaking skills in the Mastermind Game! Good luck!
